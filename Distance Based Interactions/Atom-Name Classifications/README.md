# Atom Name Classifications
### For use with data mining in the PDB

Goal: Make data mining in the PDB easier by providing an intermediate set of names for each residue.

This folder of the repo is essentially raw data used to achieve the above goal.

The data was generated with the generate_classes.py script in FlavinDB/filter_scripts/residue_label_classes at the following [commit c03b0b98b7bd634398596d903a6b10b14954c53e](https://github.com/FlavoInformatics/FlavinDB/commit/c03b0b98b7bd634398596d903a6b10b14954c53e).
